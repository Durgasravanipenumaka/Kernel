## OPerating System :
Bring up all the devices and provide a human interface.

- Types :
1.Genaral Purpose  -> windows,Linux(not time bound,no priority)
2.Real time   -> RT Linux, FreeRTOS, VXWorks(Time bound based on priority)

## Sheduler : 
Schedules the next task to be executed.

- Types :
### 1.Round Robin :
All tasks get equal amount of time to execute.
scheduler maintains all the tasks in a linked list.
Each node in the linked list get equal amount of time to execute.

Advantages :
Every task will get time to executed.

Disadvantage :
No priority will given to any task in round robin.

### 2.Pre-emptive Priority Based Scheduler :
Higher priority task executes first.

Disadvantage :
There is a posibility of low priority task may get delayed or isolated untill the high priority tasks gets executed.

## Booting Process :
CPU have a defined address to start the execution form.
First address - 1st stage of boot loader(BIOS).
purpose of 1st stage boot loader : Basic system configuration.
Address -> Next stage of booting process.
The next stage after the first loader booting process may be 2nd stage boot loader/OS.

- What is the purpose of 2nd stage boot loader ?
1.Choice of os if multiple os are installed 
  2nd stage boot loader is optional and it comes when it requires.
2.Select boot mode : Normal /safe mode/ command prompt mode

second stage bootloader is optional.

Examples of 2nd stage boot loader : Windows boot,Linux GRUB,U-Boot.

- main.c   display.c   display.h

### Make file :
```c
SRC = main.c display.c
```
- Target is a label which is used to give as an argument to makefile to execute it.
  Target 1: dependencies
          gcc main.c display.c
  Target 2:
  Target 3 :
    .
    .

make / make <Targetname>(optional)

If there is no option argument in the make command the first argument is execute first.
If a target mentions dependencies the absence of dependent component will makes the target fail.
The statement return below target is only considered when there is  atab intendations

Ex:
Target : dependencies
         gcc main.c display.c
         command1
         command2 
         gcc main.c display.c -o mainapp   -> it creates custom file

Dependencies are opitonal if you give then the dependencies should be there if not make the target file.
We can give like this also by using SRC macro
gcc $(SRC) -o mainapp

- '#' is used to command the line in makefile.

Src :
  - main.c
  - display.c
Inc :
  - display.h

- Find all the files with .c and its extension
SRC = $(shell find -name '*.c)
- To execute shell command from make file use shell command.
- To remove make file : rm -f executablefile

Inc :
#include "display.h"
It is in user defined location.
user defined location : By default it is in current working directory if not spacified by user.
#include<> : seraches the header in predefined location and location specified by the user.
#include" " : First seraches in user defined location if not found then it will serach in the predefined location.

Make file :
```c
all :
     gcc ./src/main.c ./src/display.c  -I ./inc -o mainapp
```
- -I used to indicate include folders.
src :
main.c 
```c
 #include<stdio.h>
#include "display.h"

void main(){
        display("Hello world\n");
}
```
display.c
```c
#include<stdio.h>

void display(char *buffer){
        printf("%s\n",buffer);
}
```

inc :
display.h 
```c
#ifndef _DISPLAY_H
#define _DISPLAY_H

void display(char *buffer);

#endif
```

Make file :
```c
SRC : ./src/main.c  ./src/display.c
INC : ./inc
all :
     gcc $(SRC) -I$(INC) -o mainapp
clean :
      rm -f mainapp
```

## src (Directory)  
- lib1
- lib2
- lib3
- mainapp

## Cmake :
- CMakeLists.txt inside the source tree
  
### contents :
- commands to define project,add source,includes and executable

- projects(<projectname>) #optional
- set(<src_variable_name><src1><src2><src3>....)#mandatory
- Include_directories(
             inc_dir1/
             inc_dir2/
             .
             .)
- Add_executable(<targest name/output file name>${src_variable_name})
 
- create a bulid directory out of souce tree
- Enter inside the build directory and execute :
- Cmake<path/to/source/tree>
- Cmake scans the contents of CMakeLists.txt to generate Makefile based on the source tree
- .a = static library file ,it doesnot have main function.
- Libraries name always start with lib.

### If we have sorce code,how to generate sorce code?

main.c display.c display.c

gcc main.c display.c

Libdisplay.a lib display.a

gcc main.c-L/path/to/library-ldisplay

- -L is used to provide the path of library.
- . -> current working directory.
- l -> link the library.

Compile the file only till the object generation.
  gcc -c display.c  ->  display.o
For converting display.o to display.a
   ar -rc <libraryname.a> <objectfile.o>
   ar -> command
   Ex : ar -rc libdisplay.a display.o 

### display.h :
```c
#ifndef _DISPLAY_H
#define _DISPLAY_H

void display(char *buffer);

#endif
```
### main.c :
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include "display.h"

void main(){
        display("Hello world\n");
}
```
### display.c :
```c
#include<stdio.h>

void display(char *buffer){
        printf("%s\n",buffer);
}
```
gcc -c display.c  -> display.o
ar -rc libdisplay.a display.o  -> libdisplay.a
gcc main.c -L. -l display  -> a.out

## Project top level 
1. src
     - mainapp -> Main.c
     - disp  -> display.c
2. inc
     - disp  -> display.h
  
## Build_directory
  
- Each and every folder and subfolder will need to have CMakeLists.txt.
- CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR  -> path to source tree.
- CMAKE_BINARY_DIR  -> path to build dircetory.

add_subdirectory(<DIR_NAME)
add_subdirectory(src)

- display.c will be compiled to generate libdisplay.a and main.c will be compiled and main.c linked to libdisplay.a.

## Library creation :
add_library(<LIB_NAME>SRC)
addlibrary(display display.c)    -> it generates libdisplay.a

## Linking Libraries :
target_link_libraries(<OUTPUT_FILE><LIB_NAME>) 
target_link_libraries(mainapp display)

- Never write an absolute path in CMakeList.txt because these paths are changed.
- Use the reference of macros to access source directory path and build directory path.
- Similar source tree will be generated in the build directory and all the corresponding libraries will be placed in the corresponding location.
- Binaries which are not executable are called as archives.Ex:static library
- Binaries which are executable are called as run time outputs.

- To specify generation of runtime outputs and archeives :
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Bin)
set(CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Lib)

- Top level CMakeLists.txt will have instructions to be executed before compilation and move to subdirectories to scan another CMakeLists.txt for further instructions.

add_executable(mainapp main.c file2.c file3. file4.c ...)
- addexecutable use this souce file is to  execute and remaining files are dependencies.
- Cmake eases the creation of makefiles in a complex architectured source code.


## Compilers :
compilers translates high level language to machine understandable language.

- Based on architectures :

### Native/host compiler :
Being on a machine, compiles for same machine.

## Cross compiler :
Being aon a machine, compiles for different machine.

And generated code was not compiled on the own machine.

Either OS is differentor processor architecture is different.

This process is called cross compilation and the corresponding compiler is called cross compiler.

whenever we are compiling for the different machine we are refering to that machine called target.

X86/X64  -> intel architecture

Target -> any architecture (arm,power pc,bare meta,Linux based,RTOS based)


### c/c++ :
Unbuntu  -> gcc(c compiler) and g++ (cpp compiler)
Install gnu compilers : sudo apt-get install build-essentials

- For cross compilation we have to consider :
     - Hardware architecture
     - Vendor/Manufacture
 
- software SDK -> software development kit
- It have libraries specific to controller/processor and cross compilation.
- Vendors and manufactures have their to supply the libraries and cross compilers.
- Libraries and cross compilers are mandatory for the cross compilations.

- For cross compilations :
Preparing the build using cross compilers
1.path to the cross compiler.
2.Full label/name of the cross compiler.

CMAKE_C_COMPILER >> indicates tool for c compiler.
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER >> indicates tool for c++ compiler.


These two compilers (c and c++) indicates /user/bin path.

For cross compilation,modify these above macros (c and c++) with path of cross compiler.

cmake seraching and checking gcc and g++ in default whether present or working or not.


create <toolchain>.cmake file to provide the instructions to set cross compilation.

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE = /path/to/cmake -toolchain.cmake ../path/to project/src

Above command is used to set the cross compilation path.

To remove cmake file rm -rf *

### Steps for cross compilation :
- 1.create cmake-toolchain.cmake in top-level directory.
- 2.set the path of the compiler
  set(CC_TOOL_PATH /home/username/ti-preprocessor-sdk-linux-arm5-xx -evm-08_02_01_00/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86-64-argo-linux)
  path present in ti-processor-sdk-linux-am57xx-evm_08_02_01_00/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64_argo -linux/usr/bin
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${CC_TOOL_PATH}/usr/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
- 3.Goto build directory
  username/build_math $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../project_math/cmake-toolchain.cmake.
  cmake takes the instruction from cmake-toolchain.cmake before starting build.
  Executable mainapp present in the Bin directory.


## Linux :
- Linux Subsystems  :
    - Process management
    - Memory management 
    - Network management
    - Device management
    - File I/O management

Single program that controls all the subsystems is called Linux-Kernel.

On kernel,we will focus on device management subsystem.

Every component is accessible through individual dedicated file.

- File systems in Linux :
    - /etc/
    - /boot/
    - /dev/
    - /sys/
    - /var/
    - /lib/
    - /usr/
    - /proc/

For accessing device management subsystem /dev/ and /sys/ is used.

Except boot, all these file systems are temporary.

These file systems cannot be found on harddisk or hard drive.

These files systems are loaded only when Linux boots up.

Linux kernel loads these file systems.

They are created dynamically and loaded by Linux-kernel.

- /dev/  -> Character device files
- /sys/  -> Entities of platform devices
- /proc/ -> Details of running process

All these files system are temporary there are not present in the harddisk.

Linux loads these file systems at boot up time.

- Why we need to configure/compile kernel ?

Configure the kernel according to the peripherals present in the target board.

Drivers for the hardware which are not present in the target board should be removed from the kernel.

We are scalling down the size of kernel by removing unneccessary drivers.

Configuration is done before the compilation process.

Current running kernel will not have any effect of the configuartion changes.


- 1.Configure the kernel -> Linux source code 
- 2.Compile the kernel
     - reflect the changes
     - Compile according to the hardware architecture
- 3.Deployment (Install) the kernel.

## Prerequisities :
make utility
compiler tool chain -> host/cross

For required packages :
```c
sudo apt-get install build-essentials
```
- Primary purpose of the kernel configuration to remove or add drivers.

kconfig file  -> Provides the details of the driver

.config file  -> Keeps the information/track of saved configuration

device tree files -> Individual driver specifications

- Download the Linux kernel source code from www.kernel.org

- For checking kernel versions we use
  uname -r

- Extract the source code from tar file
  tar -xvf <version>

In Linux version we have so many folders.From that folders we are concentrating on drivers and arch folders.
Programs,kernel and other software components should be compact as much as possible. Due to limited storage size in embedded devices.

### 1.configuration :
- make menuconfig

make menuconfig provides as interactive userspace to add/remove the components.

make menuconfig requires ncurses library.

- make <> defconfig

Standard board manufactures will provide configuration files to quickly configure the linux kernel source according to their boards.

make <  > defconfig applies the configuration from the file defconfig file.
Eg : make raspi_ defconfig

If you don't have defconfig then we can go through make menuconfig.

make menuconfig presents list of drivers which are part of kernel source code.

- '*' -> The driver or component which is marked as star will be compiled and integrated to the kernel and are also called as buildin modules.

Buildin drivers cannot be removed from the running kernels.

Buildin drivers are part of kernel binary.

- 'M' -> Removable modules

Removable modules will be compiled and seperate binary will be created for corressponding driver or module.

Removable modules can be installed or removed from the kernel at any point of time.

' ' -> Excluded from compilation.

<Y> -> Build-in

<N> -> Excludes

<M> -> Modularize features

[*] -> build-in

[ ] -> excluded

<M> -> Module

< > -> Module capable

once the configuration done save the configuration before exiting make menuconfig.

- ls -a -> To see the hiodden files or files ends with '.'.

make menuconfiguration or defconfiguration the configuration are saved .config file.

Whenever we are compiling the kernel which module is build in /removable / excludes all the three will be scanned from .config file.

### Compilation :
- Legendery :

make   -> build kernel & *marked modules

make modules  -> build modules marked as M

make modules_install  -> Install all removable modules(M)

make install   -> Install the newly generated kernel

- New Kernel :

make -> build kernel and * marked modules

make module_install  -> build and install all removable module(M)

make install  -> Install the newly generated kernel

All these commands can be executed from the top level directory only.

make install  -> creates an entry in /etc/default/grub

GRUB helps to select the operating system to be booted.

At the boot up time GRUB shows the list of operating system to be selected.

 - make install
 - sudo update -grub  -> refreshes the grub menu

- def config :

From top level directory we have to go to /linux version/arch/arm/config

here config -> all def config files are present in this folder

Any new defconfig is placed in this folder only.

High light the driver and press ? to get the details of driver.

Types defines the states  

This driver have two states 
   - '*' - Y
   - [] - n

#### prompt : 
short description given to the driver in make menuconfig.

#### Location :
Indicates the location of driver i make menuconfig.

#### Defined at :
It actually shows the location of the kconfig file which is providing details of this driver.

make menuconfig is reading the kconfig files to list the drivers in the make menuconfig.

kconfig file is responsible to proviode the details of drivers to make menuconfig.

Each kconfig file will either provide the information of driver or paths to next kconfig file.

Execute make menuconfig and save it.

kconfig file provides the details of the particular driver along with configuration options in make menuconfig.

'*' in make menuconfig leads to y in .config.

'M' in make menuconfig leads to m in .config.

'[]' in make menuconfig leads to comment #.

The defconfig files also have similar macros when defconfig is applied the .config file will be updated according to the macros present in defconfig file.

Newly added driver must be populated in make menuconfig by updating its details in kconfig files.

Depends on indicates on which driver the current driver depends on.

To indicate a new driver kconfig files must be updated with the updated details of new driver.

If we use see/boot directory after compilation of kernel you find so may binaries.

kconfig file is used to integrate the driver into kernel.

After kernel compilation the name of binary generated Vmlinux.

Vmlinux  ---->  Vmlinuz

make install copy is the vmlinuz to /boot directory.

Vmlinuz is the actual kernel binary which loads when CPU boots.

- Difference between user-application and Modules :

| user-applications | Modules |
| Entry point -> main()| module_init(entry function) |
| No exut point | module_exit(exit function) |
| run in user space of RAM | Run in kernel space of RAM |
| Base for console and GUI application | Base for device drivers |
| Waits for request from user/another userapp/kernel | waits for request from userapp,another module and hardware |
| Terminates when main function terminates | remains in kernel space of RAM untill removed |
| programs running in userspace of RAM | Programs running in kernel space of RAM |

A function is passed as an argument to module_init() macro is entry point of the modules.

Function passed as an argument to module_exit() macro is exit point.

Every device driver is a module but every module is not a driver.

Module waiting for request from hardware,another module.

Kernel cannot handle the errors in module.

#### Memory Leak :
When the address to dynamically allocated memory is lost before freeing it or before deallocating, it is called memory leak.

Invalid of pointers in the module, the system will be crashed. kernel doesnot handle these in modules.

For avoiding system crash :
```c
if(*ptr != NULL){
      x=*ptr;
}
```

whenever you try to free the pointer , immmediately after freeing the pointer ,assign it to NULL.
```c
free(ptr);
ptr=NULL;
```

Even if the module is removed , dynamically allocated memory which is not freed or deallocated remains in the kernel space of RAM.

In kernel space of RAM ensure the preservance of pointer pointing to dynamically allocated memory.

Use the exit() (or) exit point to freeup or deallocate all the resources allocated by the module.

Use global pointers, instead of local pointers to extend the scope.

Kernel build will be used to compile the modules or driver never use gcc

- .c .c .c  -> a.out/executable
- .c .c .c  -> .ko file

initialization function -> entry point
Exit function -> exit point

Function to be created as an entry point should be passed as an argument to module_init() macro.
```c
module_init(function name)
```

Function to be created as an exit point should be passed as an argument to module_exit() macro.
```c
module_exit(function name)
```

printk() is used to print message in kernel log.

simple module :
```c

```
